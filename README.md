# 📊 SQL Mentor – Daily SQL Challenge (Real Dataset Analysis)

This repository contains a **SQL analysis practice project** built using a **real dataset** derived from the **SQL Mentor – Daily SQL Challenge** conducted by **Zero Analyst** on Discord.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to **practice and strengthen SQL skills** by working with a **real, non-synthetic dataset** that reflects actual user submissions and challenge activity.

Using SQL, I analyzed the data to answer **analytics-style questions**, similar to tasks performed by **Data Analysts and Business Analysts** in real-world scenarios.

---

## 📁 Dataset

* Real dataset extracted from SQL Mentor challenge activity
* Contains user-level and date-level records
* Used for aggregation, filtering, and performance analysis
* No dummy or randomly generated data

---

## 🛠 SQL Concepts Covered

* `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
* `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
* Aggregate functions: `AVG`, `COUNT`, `SUM`
* Date extraction and daily metrics
* Debugging incorrect SQL logic
* Query optimization and readability

---

## 🧩 Example Problems Solved

* Calculate **daily average points per user**
* Identify incorrect grouping logic
* Fix aggregation-related SQL errors
* Analyze user activity trends over time

These problems closely resemble **real analytics tasks** and **interview-style SQL questions**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

* Hands-on experience with **real datasets**
* Improved understanding of aggregation logic
* Stronger analytical thinking using SQL
* Better debugging of common SQL mistakes
* Practical exposure to analyst-level querying

---

## 🙌 Credits

* **SQL Mentor Bot & Daily Challenges**: Zero Analyst (Discord Community)
* **SQL Analysis & Query Implementation**: Self

All intellectual credit for the challenge framework and bot belongs to **Zero Analyst**.
